# Shopping List
- As the name says the aim of this project is to help the user create their own shopping list. 
- The user can add, filter, update and delete/clear all the items on the list. 
- This project was created to focus working on:
  - DOM
  - Events
  - Local storage and other Javascript fundamentals.
- I have also incorporated my design skills by designing the UI and the artwork on the page.
- Features to be worked on:
  -   Responsive Design
  -   Spacing between update and remove icon depending on the item character length.
